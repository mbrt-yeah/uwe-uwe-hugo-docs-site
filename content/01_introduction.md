## Introduction

Uwe Uwe (u²) is a minimalist theme that helps you build fully responsive documentation websites for small projects.

It will create a very simple website by merging all your markdown and/or html pages to **one single** `index.html` page.

No other kinds of webpages or files in other output formats are created.

The Uwe Uwe (u²) theme is most likely not for you if you need a website with a more sophisticated structure.
