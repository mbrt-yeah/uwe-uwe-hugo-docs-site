- Custom shortcodes for:
  - Info, warning and danger notifications (can also be displayed as sidenotes)
  - Tabs (can also be used for code examples)
  - Footnotes which are displayed as sidenotes or as modals on screens with a smaller horizontal screen resolution.
- Optional syntax highlighting via Prism.js{{< fn id="1" />}}
- Configurable platform links with three visualization modes (as icon, as text and icon, as text only)
- Configurable logo, short description and table of contents

{{% fn id="1" %}}
